/*The line const stars = new Array(rating).fill(null);
 is a way to create an array of a certain length
(in this case, the length is rating) and fill each 
of its items with a specific value (null in this instance).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
new Array(rating):
This creates a new array with a length of rating.
If rating is 5, this creates an array of length 5.
However, this array doesn't have any values in it yetâ€”it's sparse. 
That is, if you try to .map() over this array immediately after creating it, 
nothing will happen because there aren't any defined values in the array.

.fill(null):
To make the array usable (e.g., to be able to .map() over it), 
we need to fill it with some values. The .fill() method fills 
every index in the array with the value provided as an argument. 
In our case, we're filling each index with the value null. 
The choice of null is arbitrary here; it could be any other value. 
The important thing is that we're giving the array defined values 
so that we can then iterate over it.

So, after executing const stars = new Array(rating).fill(null);,
the variable stars holds an array with rating number of items, all 
of which are null.

For example:

If rating is 3, then stars will be [null, null, null].
If rating is 5, then stars will be [null, null, null, null, null].
The reason for this construction is to easily create an array of a 
specific length (determined by the rating) and then use that array
to generate the corresponding number of star icons. */
